# Cancer Prediction
# Big Data Mining - *CINF 401*

Submitted by: **Victor Akolo**

**Cancer Prediction** : This project aims to build and evaluate various machine learning models for predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer based on various features extracted from breast mass images. The models included in this project are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
 

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Requirements
**To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:**

- [x] 
      Python 3.x,
      NumPy,
      Pandas,
      Matplotlib,
      Seaborn,
      Scikit-learn
- [x] **You can install the required libraries using pip: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn**

## Usage

- [ ]  **Clone the repository or download the source code.**
- [ ] **Implement daily notifications to prompt users to fill in their data**
- [ ] Make sure the data.csv file is in the same directory as the Python script.
- [ ] Run the Python script data.py.


## The script will perform the following steps:

1. Load the dataset from the CSV file.
2. Perform data preprocessing and visualization.
3. Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Train and evaluate the following machine learning models:

    - Logistic Regression,
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
     - Random Forest Classifier,
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)


5. Print the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score for each model.
6. Visualize the accuracy scores of the different models using a bar plot.

## File Structure

└── README.md            


## Results
The script will output the following information for each model:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Accuracy Score

Additionally, a bar plot will be displayed, showing the accuracy scores of the different models for comparison.
